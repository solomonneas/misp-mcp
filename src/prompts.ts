Follow these steps:
1. Use misp_search_attributes to search for this IOC value across all events. If you know the type, filter by it.
2. Use misp_correlate to find all correlations for this value across events.
3. Use misp_check_warninglists to check if this value appears on any known benign/false positive lists.
4. For each event found, note the threat level, tags (especially TLP and MITRE ATT&CK), and related IOCs.
5. If the IOC appears in multiple events, use misp_get_related_events on the most relevant event to discover additional related intelligence.

Provide a structured summary including:
- Whether the IOC was found in MISP and in how many events
- Threat level assessment based on event metadata
- Related IOCs and correlations discovered
- Whether it appears on any warninglists (potential false positive)
- MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with this IOC
- Recommended next steps for the analyst`,

Follow these steps:
1. Use misp_create_event with:

   - Appropriate threat level (1=High for active compromise, 2=Medium for suspicious activity, 3=Low for informational)
   - Analysis status: 0 (Initial)
   - Distribution: 0 (Organization only) to start - can be broadened later

2. For each IOC:
   - Determine the correct attribute type (ip-src, ip-dst, domain, md5, sha256, url, etc.)
   - Use misp_add_attribute (or misp_add_attributes_bulk for multiple) to add them
   - Use misp_check_warninglists to verify none are known false positives

3. Add appropriate tags using misp_tag_event:
   - TLP tag (tlp:white, tlp:green, tlp:amber, tlp:red)
   - Relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique tags if applicable
   - Any organization-specific tags

4. Summarize what was created:
   - Event ID and title
   - Number of attributes added
   - Tags applied
   - Ask if the analyst wants to publish (misp_publish_event) or keep as draft`,

2. **Key Events**: List the most significant events with threat levels and descriptions
3. **IOC Summary**:
   - Use misp_search_attributes to aggregate IOC types and counts
   - List the most significant indicators by type (IPs, domains, hashes, URLs)
4. **MITRE ATT&CK Coverage**: List any ATT&CK techniques observed across the events
5. **Correlations**: Use misp_correlate on high-value IOCs to discover cross-event links
6. **Recommendations**:
   - Immediate blocking actions (IPs, domains to block)
   - Detection rules needed
   - Areas requiring further investigation
